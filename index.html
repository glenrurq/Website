            <h1>Refracted Speech Recover</h1>
            <h6>"By laser"</h6>
            <p class="introduction">
              Refracted voice recovery is a concept involving a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
              microphone, a device commonly used in espionage. It uses a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
              beam to detect sound vibrations from a distant object and then
              recover noises using its surface vibrations. This technology can
              be used for spying with minimal risk of exposure, and has been
              employed by the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agencia_Central_de_Inteligencia">CIA</a>. Its capabilities have enabled the
              implementation of highly confidential missions, which in most
              cases have resulted in resounding success.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-04-03 165311.png" alt="Leon Theremin">
            <p>
              The concept of capturing sound by analyzing vibrations reflected
              off surfaces dates back to the early 20th century. At that time,
              scientists were already experimenting with optical methods to
              detect sound, although the technology was not advanced enough to
              do so effectively. During the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Guerra_Fr%C3%ADa">Cold War</a> (1947–1991), the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB">KGB</a> and
              <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agencia_Central_de_Inteligencia">CIA</a> explored the possibility of listening to conversations
              remotely using advanced surveillance technologies. However, laser
              technology was not fully developed until the second half of the
              20th century. The technique of using a beam of light to record
              sound remotely was likely devised by Léon Theremin in the Soviet
              Union in or before 1947, when he developed and used the Buran spy
              system. This system operated by using a low-power infrared beam
              (not a laser) at a distance to detect vibrations in window panes.
              Lavrentiy Beria, director of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB">KGB</a>, used the Buran system to spy
              on the American, British, and French embassies in Moscow. This
              highly effective method gradually gained popularity among other
              intelligence and security agencies.

            <h3>How it works?</h3>
            <img src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/df5b901abd3abe64a1a5dd642a217c7b1b66abf5/1-Figure1-1.png" alt="Laser microphone working">
            <p>
              The main purpose of a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> microphone is to capture conversations
              within a room without having to place a listening device inside.
              To achieve this, it exploits the principle that any object within
              the room can vibrate slightly due to the pressure waves generated
              by sound. These vibrations are imperceptible to the human eye but
              can be detected using advanced optical techniques.
              <br /><br />
              The <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> microphone directs a coherent beam of light into the
              room through a window, with the intention that the beam hits a
              surface that vibrates subtly due to ambient sound. Ideally, the
              target should have a smooth, reflective surface, such as a picture
              on the wall, a hanging lamp, a glass bottle, or even the window
              itself. However, it is also possible to capture information if the
              beam reflects off less ideal surfaces, although with a loss in
              signal quality.
              <br /><br />
              Once the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> hits the object within the room, it is reflected
              back to a receiver, usually a photodiode or interferometer, which
              is responsible for analyzing the variations in the reflected
              light. These variations are extremely subtle and are directly
              related to the vibrations of the object caused by the sound inside
              the room. They can also be affected by external factors.
              <br /><br />
              The fundamental principle behind modern <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> microphones is
              interferometry, which measures tiny changes in the distance
              traveled by light. When the object vibrates due to sound waves,
              the distance the light travels between the transmitter and
              receiver changes by tiny amounts, on the order of nanometers or
              even picometers.
              <br /><br />
              The interferometer detects these variations in the light's path
              length and translates them into fluctuations in light intensity.
              These changes are then electronically processed by circuits that
              convert the optical signal into an electrical signal that
              represents the original sound in the room. Once the electrical
              signal is obtained, it can be amplified and filtered to improve
              the intelligibility of the captured audio. These amplifiers are
              similar to those in a speaker or microphone, but on a larger
              scale.
              <br /><br />
              In some cases, instead of aiming directly at an object within the
              room, the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> beam can be reflected off the window itself. Since
              glass also vibrates in response to sound waves from within, it can
              act as a "membrane" that transmits vibrations to the reflected
              light beam. However, this method presents some challenges, as
              windows often have multiple layers of glass and coatings that can
              affect the quality of the reflected signal.
              <br /><br />
              To improve the effectiveness of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> microphone, operators
              often look for specific points where the vibration is most
              pronounced, or even employ techniques such as using multiple <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
              beams to improve the accuracy of the interferometric analysis.

            <h3>Use examples</h3>
            <p>
              While many details about the use of <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
              microphones in modern operations remain classified, both the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agencia_Central_de_Inteligencia">CIA</a>
              and the FBI are known to have employed this technology in
              surveillance missions. In the fight against terrorism and
              organized crime, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> microphones have reportedly been used to
              capture conversations from safe distances without the need to
              place physical devices in the target area. In several high-profile
              investigations, federal agents have used this technology to
              monitor clandestine meetings of suspects without being detected.
              <br /><br />
              Laser microphones have also found applications in engineering and
              structural safety. Researchers at <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratorio_Nacional_Lawrence_Berkeley">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> have used advanced laser systems to analyze vibrations
              in buildings and bridges. This technique allows structural
              failures to be detected without physical contact, which is
              especially useful in older structures or bridges in use where
              traditional inspection could be dangerous.
              <br /><br />
              In the medical field, researchers at the University of Illinois
              have developed a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a> microphone-based technique to analyze the
              vibration of patients' vocal cords. This noninvasive method can
              detect speech disorders or early signs of neurological diseases
              such as Parkinson's disease, without the need to place electrodes
              or devices on the patient's throat.
              <br /><br />
              In 2019, the U.S. Army announced the development of a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>-based
              system capable of capturing long-distance conversations by
              detecting vibrations in different surfaces. It was suggested that
              this technology could be used in military reconnaissance
              operations, allowing the armed forces to obtain information
              without having to deploy troops to the target area.
